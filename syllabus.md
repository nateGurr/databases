# Databases

This course will introduce students to database design, Structured Query Language (SQL), normalization, and relational database theory. Traditional relational databases will be contrasted with NoSQL paradigm databases including document-oriented, key-value store, and graph. Students will gain hands-on experience writing database applications.. [Course Catalog](https://classlist.champlain.edu/show/course/number/CSI_300)

## Phylosophy

This course takes a top-down, DevOps-first approach to database management. Students learn by doing. Every concept is reinforced through hands-on coding assignments automatically tested via GitHub Actions. The course emphasizes:

- _Infrastructure as Code_: All databases run in Docker containers
- _Continuous Integration_: Assignments auto-graded via GitHub Actions
- _Real-World Practices_: Version control, testing, and deployment pipelines
- _Breadth of Knowledge_: SQL foundations + modern database paradigms
