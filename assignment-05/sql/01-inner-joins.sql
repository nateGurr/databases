-- Problem 1.1 (4 points)
-- Basic Two-Table Join: Completed appointments with patient and doctor names
-- Return: patient_name (full name), doctor_name (full name), scheduled_at, visit_type, reason
-- Filter: Only completed appointments
-- Order by: scheduled_at descending
-- Tables: appointments, patients, doctors
-- Tip: Use CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) for full names
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- TODO: Write your SELECT statement here


-- Problem 1.2 (4 points)
-- Join with Department Information: Active doctors with their departments
-- Return: doctor_name, department_name, location, hire_date
-- Filter: Only active doctors (is_active = true)
-- Order by: department name, then last_name
-- Tables: doctors, departments
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- TODO: Write your SELECT statement here


-- Problem 1.3 (4 points)
-- Many-to-Many Join: Doctors and their specializations
-- Return: doctor_name, specialization_name, is_primary, certified_date
-- Order by: doctor last_name, is_primary descending, specialization name
-- Tables: doctors, doctor_specializations, specializations
-- Tip: Many-to-many requires joining through the junction table

-- Problem 1.4 (4 points)
-- Join with Filtering: Cardiology appointments in 2024
-- Return: patient_name, doctor_name, scheduled_at, visit_type, reason
-- Filter: Cardiology department, year 2024
-- Tables: appointments, patients, doctors, departments
-- Tip: Use EXTRACT(YEAR FROM scheduled_at) = 2024
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- TODO: Write your SELECT statement here


-- Problem 1.5 (4 points)
-- Multiple Joins with Aggregation: Doctor appointments by department
-- Return: department_name, doctor_name, appointment_count
-- Filter: Only departments with more than 5 total appointments
-- Order by: department_name, appointment_count descending
-- Tables: departments, doctors, appointments
-- Tip: Use subquery in WHERE to filter departments, then GROUP BY doctor
