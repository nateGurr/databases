-- Exercise 1: Introduction to Subqueries
-- PawCare Veterinary Clinic
-- =============================================================================

-- Task 1.1: Scalar Subquery in SELECT (4 points)
-- Display each pet's weight compared to the average of all pets
-- Return: pet_name, weight_kg, avg_all_pets, weight_difference
-- Filter: Only pets with weight recorded (NOT NULL)
-- Order by: weight_difference descending
-- Tables: pets
-- Tip: Use (SELECT AVG(weight_kg) FROM pawcare.pets WHERE weight_kg IS NOT NULL) as scalar subquery

-- TODO: Write your SELECT statement here


-- Task 1.2: Scalar Subquery in WHERE (4 points)
-- Find pets whose weight is above the average weight of their species
-- Return: pet_name, species_name, weight_kg
-- Order by: species_name, weight_kg descending
-- Tables: pets, species
-- Tip: Use correlated subquery: WHERE p.weight_kg > (SELECT AVG(...) WHERE species_id = p.species_id)

-- Task 1.3: Using IN with Subqueries (4 points)
-- Find owners who have pets that have been seen by the emergency clinic (clinic_id = 4)
-- Return: first_name, last_name, email
-- Tables: owners, pets, appointments
-- Tip: Use nested IN subqueries: owner_id IN (SELECT ... WHERE pet_id IN (SELECT ...))

-- TODO: Write your SELECT statement here


-- Task 1.4: Using NOT IN (4 points)
-- Find pets that have NEVER had a vaccination recorded
-- Return: pet_name, species_name, owner_full_name
-- Order by: species_name, pet_name
-- Tables: pets, species, owners, vaccinations
-- Tip: WHERE pet_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT pet_id FROM vaccinations)
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- TODO: Write your SELECT statement here


-- Task 1.5: Subquery in FROM Clause (Derived Table) (4 points)
-- Calculate total revenue by clinic using a subquery in FROM
-- Return: clinic_name, total_revenue, avg_invoice
-- Order by: total_revenue descending
-- Tables: clinics, invoices, appointments
-- Tip: Join clinics to a subquery that aggregates invoices by clinic
